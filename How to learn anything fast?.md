# UNDERDEVEL
### Intro
- I am a Software Developer for more than 5 years now. The the work involved in my profession is keep changing in few years & the work i do is also push me to read many lengthy docs every day. Although my project deadline not permit me to learn each & every word, concept & mechanism from the doc. And yet i have to build some greate thing using those insufficient(i would say not solid) knowledge.
- Apart from this i also want to keep updating my self with new knowledge & skills for my personal development. This doesnt bother me rather i like it cause I am Learning Junkie & I have real learning appetite.
- As per my current job, i am SoC modeling engineer & my day to day work involves reading specification which are boring lengthy & not solid. Some time customer not provide enough information for their safety/proprietory or whatever reason. In this case, we have to guess the functionality on the basis of expirience & contex in which we are going to use those IP. Moreover 50% information is not available on internet because the thing on which we are working is either proprietory or being develop 1st time.
- This scenario gives me opportunity to find process, tips & tricks on how to learn fast.
- This article would be subjective thing. But still i want to saw my perspective to world. Which may or may not help someone. So i was in search of formula which i can apply anywhere to learn things faster. Here is my observation:
### Learning vs Memorizing vs Skill
- I would define "Learning" as process of acquiring new knowledge.
- "Memorizing" is process of storing the infromation in certain form in our brain. Mind that i have used words "ceratin form" here becuase i don't know how information stores in brain but as per my intellect i can prove that it stored using metadata as we store files in OS. For example, i would ask you "What you ate yesterday in lunch?", you probably have to recall that. But if you found some bug in your rice bowl or something heppens with food you were eating, you might be remember it nicely without recalling it right now. So that bug or situation is metadata for your information.
- Skill is enforcing acquired knowledge into real life to sick some kind of benefit from life. For example your mother tongue, you have not done any course or academic to learn your mother tongue language. You learned it just by listing & watching how other peoople around you speaking it while you were child. Later on you learned to write & read that language in academics & using it for now to communication with people around you. 


### Learning faster
- There is no shortcuts believe me. This is truth.
- Even science proved that when you learn something new it will create/alter neurons structure in your brain. But this structure take time to strengthen its connection. When you do spaced-repetition, practice or test your self this connection strengthen over the time. This will create long term memory. And this is the real process how your brain learn things.
- But yes there are techniques by which you can absorb information plausibly fast & for longer period of time.

Problem statement: First time learning something
- The first time you do something the deluge of information coming at you would make the job seem almost impossibly difficult. You will be overwhelmed by amout of information & your brain is trained in a fashion that it will focus on result directly. 
- In this there will be two possibility
1. Either you procastinate & focus on other thing which will please your mind temporarily.
2. Or you start will great enthusiasm just by considering result & you left it somewhere in between your struggle.

Both the way you are not achieving anything.
Default brain reactions: Anxiety, Frustration, Angry & what not.

- Rather what you have to do is 
Step 0(KICKSTART): Just dont think anything, START DOING.
Step 1(BRIEFING): Go through major ideas, key concepts or points quickly.
Step 2(CHUNKING): Start chunking it and read those points individually in layman term. Also boil down concept in simple words, sentences or visual image. In order to master a concept, you not only need to know it but also to know how it fits into the bigger picture.
Step 3(CONNECTING-DOTS): By the end of your all chunk understanding. Your mind automatically try to connect those chunks with each other and eventualy you will get bigger picture. I am pretty sure all these chunks are connected to each other with some relation, use or context.

This is very abstract process. There are other parameters which hamper with this learning is like unable to remember, distractions, focus, interest, etc. which we will see in later in this article.

Helpers
- Distractions: Do not place your mobile or distracting/addictive thing infront of study material. Use pomodoro technique. Try to focus on developing process rather focusing on product.
- Procrastination: When facing procrastination, think of process over product. I often procrastinate when I’m overwhelmed by the thought, “Ok, I have to get X done”. Instead, it can be beneficial to think, “Ok, I will spend an hour on X” — which isn’t overwhelming, doesn’t require a long breakdown of tasks, and gets me started (90% of the battle).

### Memorizing it better

Step 0(SPACED-REPETITION): Outcome of chunking is single abstract word or sentence. You need to write it some where and need to re-learn it over the time. Why over the time is because neural structure takes time to strengthen its connection. This stong connection makes long term memory.
Step 1(INTERLEAVING): Once you have a basic understanding of what you are trying to learn, interleaving can be used to help you master the concepts. By practicing jumping back and forth between problems that require different techniques, you can solidify your understanding of the concepts by learning how to choose to apply them in various situations. 
Step 2(TEST): In order to avoid or break through illusions of competence, you should test yourself as you’re encountering new material. Recall is a simple example of this mini-testing. So keep testing your knowledge to different scenario.

Helpers
- For spaced-repetition, Flashcards might help(Consider using Anki). Although i use google keep with reminder once a day and go though words of vocabulary. Visual image will also be much beneficial. 
- Find out the route cause of problem why it arised at first place. Which forms complete story. As most of the story is divided in three part beginning, struggle & happy-ending. So finding reason "why we need it?" makes your topic as a story & solution would be happy ending, trying different things to find solution to that topic is your struggle. And story is easy to remember.
- Also try to connect ideas. Though seriously, connecting ideas not only helps you remember them easier (like using landmarks helps prevent getting lost) it also helps you use the ideas more efficiently! You can connect the ideas and have them work together during the problem solving process.
- Handwriting helps you deeply convert what you are trying to learn into neural memory structures.





### Converting it to skill
- This is untouched portion no one talks about. According to me, what is point of knowledge that you can not use in real life(its kind of learning about ghost).
- Know when to apply a particular concept is as important as knowing how.

Beware of Illusions of Competence: There are many ways in which we can make ourselves feel like we have “learned” a concept. For example, looking at a solution and thinking that you know how to arrive at that solution is one of the most common illusions of competence in learning. Highlighting or underlining are also techniques that often lead to this illusion of learning. On the other hand, brief notes that summarize keys concepts are much more effective like flashcards. Pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, bond together through use and meaning. 


### Confirming aquired skill/concept/lerning
- You should be able to visualize thing in mind.
- You will be able to teach that thing to non-technical person.
- You explain it to someone with block digram in 5-10 mins.

### Bottom line
Finding a subject

Reading/viewing videos about it

Talking about it with other peoples interested in the subject (reddit is useful for that).

Keeping doing that for every subject I've practiced until now.


Finally, this is advice I've only taken recently, really pay attention to your mental health. It is really easy to get caught up in the pursuit of knowledge and lose sight of everything else. You can kind of dehumanize everyone else because of views or thoughts that you consider foolish. Before you know it you have isolated yourself from everyone, lost any trace of empathy, and are struggling to maintain normal human relationships now. That last part might be a little too personal to my situation haha, but you get the idea.
### Do's
- Your errors are sometimes easier to be found by others.
- Explaining yourself to others helps you understand more.
- Alwasy ask questions like how & why? this will lead you to story or purpose things you are doing right now & help you create long term memory.
### Don'ts 
- Pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, bond together through use and meaning. 
- A big mistake is to blindly start working on an exercise without reading the textbook or attending the class. 
- Procrastination:you procastinate because of overwhelmed by information. To avoid this use pomodoro & focus on process rather complete product.
- Having fixed mindset rather than growth mindset.

### Uncatagorized
- Till the time i was maitaining todo list, but never making it empty. There is always something in it which gives me continuous anxiety. Now i have learned to deal with todo list. Till the time i was only known to make todo list, but not learned it to achieve it in rightful manner. 
- A good way to pay attention in a boring class is to ask a question - it clears your doubt, it creates a possibly more interesting discussion, it is a more active learning process.
- There’s a lot of this stuff out there supported by good evidence (and some less so), but unfortunately most of the best is buried deep in the scientific literature, where it’s not super accessible for students busy learning other things.
-  As i said spaced repeatition will help. What i do is maintain online notes with reminder of every morning 9 AM when my day starts.

### Closing article

- It is inevitable that you will forget the finer details of a large percent of what you learn, but by discovering how you learn best and teaching yourself the proper techniques you can dramatically lower that percentage and increase your retention as well as the amount of time it takes you to relearn a piece of information.
