# UNDERDEVEL
### Intro
- I am Learning Junkie.
- My profession is keep changing in 4-5  year time period & the work i do is also push me to read many lengthy docs every day. Although my project deadline is not permit me to learn each & every word,concept, mechanism, etc from the doc. And yet i have to build some greate thing using those not-sufficient knowledge.
- As per my current job, i am SoC modeling engineer & my day to day work involves reading specification which are boring lengthy & not solid.Some time customer not provide enough knowledge for their safety or whatever reason & we have to guess the functionality on the basis of expirience & contex in which we are going to use those IP. Moreover 50% information is not available on internet because the thing on which we are working is either proprietory or being develop 1st time.
- So i was in search of formula which i can apply anywhere to learn things faster. Here is my observation:
### Define the problem

### Why it needed at 1st place?

### What are the drawbacks of learning that thing.
