# UNDERDEVEL
### Intro
- I am Learning Junkie.
- Thw work involved in my profession is keep changing in few years & the work i do is also push me to read many lengthy docs every day. Although my project deadline is not permit me to learn each & every word, concept & mechanism from the doc. And yet i have to build some greate thing using those insufficient knowledge.
- As per my current job, i am SoC modeling engineer & my day to day work involves reading specification which are boring lengthy & not solid.Some time customer not provide enough information for their safety/proprietory or whatever reason.In this case, we have to guess the functionality on the basis of expirience & contex in which we are going to use those IP. Moreover 50% information is not available on internet because the thing on which we are working is either proprietory or being develop 1st time.
- This article would be subjective thing. But still i want to saw my perspective to world. Which may or may not help someone. So i was in search of formula which i can apply anywhere to learn things faster. Here is my observation:
### Learning vs Memorizing vs Skill
- I would define "Learning" as process of acquiring new knowledge.
- I would define "Memorizing" as process of storing the infromation in certain formation in our brain. Mind that i have used word certaing here becuase i dont know how information stores in brain but as per my intellect i can prove that it stored using metadata as we store files in OS. For example i would ask you "What you ate yesterday in lunch?", you probably have to recall that. But if you found some bug in your rice bowl or something heppens with food your were eating, you might be remember it nicely without recalling it right now.
- Skill is enforcing acquired knowledge into real life to sick some other benefit from life. For example your mother tongue, you have not done any course or acedemic related to your mother tongue language you learned it just by listing & watching how other peoople around you speaking it while you were child. Later on you learned to write & read that language in academics & using it for now. 

- There’s a lot of this stuff out there supported by good evidence (and some less so), but unfortunately most of the best is buried deep in the scientific literature, where it’s not super accessible for students busy learning other things.
### Learning faster

### Memorizing it better
- Find out the route cause of problem why it arised at first place. Which forms complete story. As most of the story is divided in three part beginning-struggle-happy-ending. So finding reason "why we need it?" makes your topic as a story & solution would be happy ending reading that topic is your struggle. And story is easy to remember.
- Also try to connect ideas.Though seriously, connecting ideas not only helps you remember them easier (like using landmarks helps prevent getting lost) it also helps you use the ideas more efficiently! You can connect the ideas and have them work together during the problem solving process.
- Once you really understand something you can relate it to many things.
- It is inevitable that you will forget the finer details of a large percent of what you learn, but by discovering how you learn best and teaching yourself the proper techniques you can dramatically lower that percentage and increase your retention as well as the amount of time it takes you to relearn a piece of information.

### Converting it to skill


### Confirming aquired skill/concept/lerning
- You should be able to visualize thing in mind.
- You will be able to teach that thing to non-technical person.
- You explain it to someone with block digram in 5-10 mins.

### Bottom line
Finding a subject

Reading/viewing videos about it

Talking about it with other peoples interested in the subject (reddit is useful for that).

Keeping doing that for every subject I've practiced until now.


Finally, this is advice I've only taken recently, really pay attention to your mental health. It is really easy to get caught up in the pursuit of knowledge and lose sight of everything else. You can kind of dehumanize everyone else because of views or thoughts that you consider foolish. Before you know it you have isolated yourself from everyone, lost any trace of empathy, and are struggling to maintain normal human relationships now. That last part might be a little too personal to my situation haha, but you get the idea.

### Evils & Enemies
- 

### Uncatagorized
- Till the time i was maitaining todo list, but never making it empty. There is always something in it which gives me continuous anxiety. Now i have learned to deal with todo list. Till the time i was only known to make todo list, but not learned it to achieve it in rightful manner.
