### Insert alternate blank row

**Problem** : I have data filled from A1 to A4 continuously. I want to insert alternate blank row.

**Step 1**: You need a blank column adjacent to your data. For example, `A1` to `A4` is our origin data, then we need `B1` to `B4`.
**Step 2**: In cell `B1` input the number 1, and input 2 in cell `B2` & drag it till `B4`, Excel will auto-fill the cells in column B.
**Step 3**: Then copy this new column B (B1:B4), select the cell `B5`, and paste.
**Step 4**: And then click `Data` -> `Sort`, and a Sort Warning dialog box will pop out, select `Expand the selection` option, and click `Sort`.
**Step 5**. And a Sort dialog box will appear, choose `Column B` from the Sort by dropdown list. And click `OK`.
